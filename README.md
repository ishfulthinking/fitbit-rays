# Rays
Rays is a clock face for the Fitbit Ionic. I created it because I wanted to try my hand at creating a more decorative clock face that was still functional and data-generous (i.e. shows goals, battery, and heart rate).

## Features
* Time display is configurable (12 hour or 24 hour)  
* Shows current day of the week and date  
* Displays current heart rate (if available) in BPM
  - Heart rate zone is displayed as text as well
* Displays battery level as both percentage and as a bar for at-a-glance understanding
* 4 "rays" display user's progress toward goals as a growing, colored strip, so user knows how close they are to goals
  - Each ray has an icon as a label and text corresponding to the goal, such as number of steps
  - The icon changes from an outline to an opaque symbol when the goal is reached
  - Distance traveled stat checks user settings to scale based on kilometers or miles  
    
#### Updates (Current version: 1.0)
* None, I just started! But I plan to optimize the bar growth formula since it's a little messy and off-kilter right now.
